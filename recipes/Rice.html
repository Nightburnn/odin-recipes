	<h2>What is Rice?</h2>
	<p>Rice is the seed of the grass species<strong><em> Oryza sativa or less commonly Oryza glaberrima</em></strong>. The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice">Wikipedia</a></p>

        <li>1/4 cup of groundnut oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups of parboiled rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp curry powder</li>

	<h4>How to prepare JOllof Rice</h4>
	<ol>
		<p>
			<li><strong>Blending:</strong>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.<img src="https://eatwellabi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pepper-mix-blend-720x672.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" alt="Sauce"></li>
		</p>
		<p><li><strong>Adding the sauce:</strong>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn</li></p>

		<p><li><strong>After 30 minutes:</strong> turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li></p>

		<p><li><strong>Adding Rice:</strong>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes</li></p>

		<p><li><strong>Finally:</strong>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li></p>
